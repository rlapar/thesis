Public-key cryptography has gained its importance in the late 70's. One of the most commonly used cryptosystems nowadays is RSA. The essential demand on this cryptosystem is security. RSA exists in many variants with different implementations. Each implementation chooses a slightly different approach to generate public and private keys to achieve the right balance between security, efficiency, and randomness. Some implementations are openly known, like OpenSSL, but some other like Microsoft CryptoAPI or Yubikey are not published. With each implementation being different, there is a slight bias introduced in public keys generation, which leads to distinct sample space for different sources. 

These biases can be completely harmless, or they can have serious security impacts. Example of this is a recently discovered flaw in Infineon chips\cite{svenda_2}, which affected more than 50\% of Estonian eID's. This could potentially lead to forging of e-signatures of the residents. The same chip was also used in Slovak eID's, albeit with less volume of affected people.

The internet contains a huge amount of randomly collected dumps of RSA public keys collected from unknown sources. If one could accurately link a particular key to its source, knowing the weakness of this source, he would be able to use specific factorization method to break the public key. The introduction to public cryptosystems and overview of RSA is presented in chapter \ref{chapter-rsa}.

The aim of this thesis is to further extend the previous research of CROCS team \cite{svenda_1}\cite{svenda_3} lead by Petr Å venda. We presented their previous work in chapter \ref{chapter-prev-work}. Our main goal was to study the usage of different machine learning methods to classify public keys, while specifically focusing on neural networks and comparing them to classic methods like naive bayes. The question was how much better they perform, or if they even perform better than other machine learning models. Neural networks are explained in chapter \ref{chapter-ml} alongside with all of its terminology used the thesis.

From the CROCS team, we obtained a dataset of more than 100 million public keys from 64 different sources. We performed a detailed analysis of this dataset over particular features mainly focusing to find non-uniform distribution over its sample space. In chapter \ref{chapter-dataset} we present the analysis results and the dataset description. During the analysis, we discovered a small bias in the most significant bits of a big number of sources from popular libraries like OpenSSL or Libgcrypt.

As a part of this thesis, we implemented a method to work with this dataset efficiently, analyze and train different machine learning models while focusing on being easily extensible with new models. The implementation process is described in chapter \ref{chapter-implementation}.

Methodologically, we trained thousands of neural network models over several generated datasets. We compared and discussed the optimal models. Our results presented in chapter \ref{chapter-results} show that the neural networks have slightly better overall accuracy when compared to the classical methods like Naive Bayes.
