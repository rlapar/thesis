\chapter{Notes}

\textbf{PIPELINE}
\begin{itemize}

\item dataset
\item key batch available
\item set of scripts over dataset
\item features from paper [Svenda2]
\item analysis of dataset (distributions of moduli)
\item feature engineering
\item different models (Scikit-learn models, keras models)
\item better results than svenda
\item needed optimization (usage of python generators) to be able to work with huge dataset in memory
\item this leads to better usage o metacentrum as well
\item next step was to split up the dataset into sources only and check this
\item split and merge groups (especially G13)
\item g15 binary classifier
\item yubikey binary classifier (same chip for infineon/yubikey)
\item sampling of training dataset 
\item Scripts to work with dataset (url)
\item preprocessed dataset (url) and final models git
\item every used model theory (multilayer perceptron, binary classifier, deep learning)
\item pandas, keras docs
\item similar work (mention Svenda papers, THESIS1, THESIS2)

\item implementation chapter (with dataset section)
\item metacentrum
\item grid search

\item Appendix (example of app cli run)
\item Appendix (app structure)

\end{itemize}
