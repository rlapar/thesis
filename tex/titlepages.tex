\thesislong{abstract} {This thesis focuses on the study of deep learning in cryptography. It includes the analysis of more than 20 different sources of RSA cryptographic libraries and cards and the bias introduced in the process of primes generation. It presents the flow of working with given dataset and implements two different classifiers, which are then compared to the traditional methods already used in the field.}

\thesislong{thanks} {I would like to thank my supervisor doc. RNDr. Tomáš Brázdil, Ph.D. for his guidance and advice in the field. Moreover, I would like to thank RNDr. Petr Švenda, Ph.D. and RNDr. Matúš Nemec from the CROCS lab for the consultations and assistance during the whole process.}
